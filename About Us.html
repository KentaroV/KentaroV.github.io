				<p class="sentence">I am a  future engineer/programmer at CAMS. I believe that <q>trash</q> and <q>waste</q> are not completely unusable and can be re-used to improve our living condition. The Earth we live on is an important habitat which we should never treat as harshly as we are now. FIND will cleanse the world of it's <q>waste</q> and help keep our precious planet alive. 
				</p>
				<p class ="sentence">CAMS is a great school which I am proud to be enrolled in. Before CAMS I did not focus on anything, and wander about from interest to interest, unfocused on school. CAMS has laid a track for me to blaze on now that my energy is in one place; school, and extracurriculars. Yet, CAMS has <q>trash</q> problems as well, further expressing the importance of FIND.

				<p class="sentence">One of my greatest hobbies traveling. By exploring the wilderness, I have seen many wonders of nature ranging from mountain ranges to beautiful oceans. Sadly I have also seen what pollution and waste have done to our planet. By creating FIND, I hope to counter these problems so people in the future can enjoy the priceless nature.

				<h4 class = "role">Harmonizer + Recorder</h4>
				<p class="sentence"> I am currently a 15 year old high school student in California Academy of Mathematics and Science who enjoy computer programming, engineering, and robotics. I believe that the environment is being affected by our production of waste which we should be reusing rather than leaving them in landfills. By doing so FIND will help reuse and reduce the waste to help improve the environment.
				</p>
				<p class="sentence">I believe that reducing the pollution and waste will help solve many problems that the world has and improve the situation some people are living in. I want to be part of the change that would make this happen. Being in the company  FIND, it will help the world be a better place.

				<h3 class = "name">Sean Sng</h3>
				<h4 class = "role">Mathematician</h4>
				<p class="sentence">Sean is a high school student at CAMS, a nationally-ranked magnet school devoted to educating students about mathematics and science. He believes that the single greatest detriment to humanity is the over-abundance of trash and other waste products, most of which can be recycled or reused. Waste products such as plastic only photodegrade, meaning that a piece of plastic will never completely disappear. Sean also believes that, through FIND, humanity can reduce the amount of waste products that do not get recycled or reused in some way. FIND can help restore the earth to its original, untarnished state one step at a time.

				<p class="sentence">Hi my name is Maurice Torres, a 14 years old, a student at CAMS, and I believe that we as people are getting rid of our “waste” or “trash” ineffectively and are polluting and damaging our own planet. Which is why I have decided to find a way to improve how we dispose of waste by becoming a part of and working with the members of FIND. I want to decrease the excess waste because I want to make a better tomorrow for everyone. Waste causes many problems we have today and I really want to solve those problems by solving the big problem we have which is waste disposal.
